# Package-Saver
A horrendously poorly made program to save packages installed with apt so they can more easily be restored on a different computer.

  Install Instructions:
cd to the source folder
run    chmod +x install-aptsave
run    ./install-aptsave
done. optionally delete the source code directory, as it is no longer needed.

alternatively just copy the program into /bin directy since this program is really simple.
